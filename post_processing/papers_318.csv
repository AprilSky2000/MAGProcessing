Terrill, Garnett W. Bryant","We designed and evaluated SplitVector, a new vector field display approach to help scientists perform new discrimination tasks on scientific data shown in virtual environments (VEs). Our empirical study compared the SplitVector approach with three other approaches of direct linear representation, log, and text display common in information-rich VEs or IRVEs. Our results suggest the following: (1) SplitVectors improve the accuracy by about 10 times compared to the linear mapping and by 4 times to log in discrimination tasks; (2) SplitVectors lead to no significant differences from the IRVE text display approach, yet reduce the clutter; and (3) SplitVector improved task performance in both mono and stereoscopy conditions.",
2,1561369684,Composing DTI Visualizations with End-user Programming,2013,23,2,1.0,arXiv: Graphics,"Haipeng Cai, Jian Chen, Alexander P. Auchus, David H. Laidlaw","We present the design and prototype implementation of a scientific visualization language called Zifazah for composing 3D visualizations of diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI or DTI) data. Unlike existing tools allowing flexible customization of data visualizations that are programmer-oriented, we focus on domain scientists as end users in order to enable them to freely compose visualizations of their scientific data set. We analyzed end-user descriptions extracted from interviews with neurologists and physicians conducting clinical practices using DTI about how they would build and use DTI visualizations to collect syntax and semantics for the language design, and have discovered the elements and structure of the proposed language. Zifazah makes use of the initial set of lexical terms and semantics to provide a declarative language in the spirit of intuitive syntax and usage. This work contributes three, among others, main design principles for scientific visualization language design as well as a practice of such language for DTI visualization with Zifazah. First, Zifazah incorporated visual symbolic mapping based on color, size and shape, which is a sub-set of Bertin's taxonomy migrated to scientific visualizations. Second, Zifazah is defined as a spatial language whereby lexical representation of spatial relationship for 3D object visualization and manipulations, which is characteristic of scientific data, can be programmed. Third, built on top of Bertin's semiology, flexible data encoding specifically for scientific visualizations is integrated in our language in order to allow end users to achieve optimal visual composition at their best. Along with sample scripts representative of our language design features, some new DTI visualizations as the running results created by end users using the novel visualization language have also been presented.",18.0

Auchus","We present a parallel visualization algorithm for the illustrative rendering of depth-dependent stylized dense tube data at interactive frame rates. While this computation could be efficiently performed on a GPU device, we target a parallel framework to enable it to be efficiently running on an ordinary multi-core CPU platform which is much more available than GPUs for common users. Our approach is to map the depth information in each tube onto each of the visual dimensions of shape, color, texture, value, and size on the basis of Bertin's semiology theory. The purpose is to enable more legible displays in the dense tube environments. A major contribution of our work is an efficient and effective parallel depthordering algorithm that makes use of the message passing interface (MPI) with VTK. We evaluated our framework with visualizations of depth-stylized tubes derived from 3D diffusion tensor MRI data by comparing its efficiency with several other alternative parallelization platforms running the same computations. As our results show, the parallelization framework we proposed can efficiently render highly dense 3D data sets like the tube data and thus is useful as a complement to parallel visualization environments that rely on GPUs.",

The term, provenance, has been used in a variety of ways to describe different types of records and histories related to visualization. The existing body of provenance research has grown to a point where the consolidation of design knowledge requires cross-referencing a variety of projects and studies spanning multiple domain areas. We present an organizational framework of the different types of provenance information and purposes for why they are desired in the field of visual analytics. Our organization is intended to serve as a framework to help researchers specify types of provenance and coordinate design knowledge across projects.

One of the difficulties which must be overcome with HumMod is the fact that the number of parameters is prohibitive in developing a clear and comprehensive view of the interactions between parameters. Currently the HumMod model contains more than 5000 variables. Therefore, good visualization techniques are needed to discern non-obvious relationships between variables. We present HumMod Navigator, a multiple-scale physiology data browser for exploring casual relationships of time-varying human modeling data.

Our goal is to reflect on a meta-level about evaluation in our community through a systematic understanding of the characteristics and goals of presented evaluations. For this purpose we conducted a systematic review of ten years of evaluations in the published papers using and extending a coding scheme previously established by Lam et al. [2012]. The results of our review include an overview of the most common evaluation goals in the community, how they evolved over time, and how they contrast or align to those of the IEEE Information Visualization conference. In particular, we found that evaluations specific to assessing resulting images and algorithm performance are the most prevalent (with consistently 80-90% of all papers since 1997). However, especially over the last six years there is a steady increase in evaluation methods that include participants, either by evaluating their performances and subjective feedback or by evaluating their work practices and their improved analysis and reasoning capabilities using visual tools. Up to 2010, this trend in the IEEE Visualization conference was much more pronounced than in the IEEE Information Visualization conference which only showed an increasing percentage of evaluation through user performance and experience testing. Since 2011, however, also papers in IEEE Information Visualization show such an increase of evaluations of work practices and analysis as well as reasoning using visual tools. Further, we found that generally the studies reporting requirements analyses and domain-specific work practices are too informally reported which hinders cross-comparison and lowers external validity.",30.0

We first present a tag cloud technique to reveal the significance of time-varying attributes and then study how a chain of tag clouds can form an exploratory visuailzation that assist multiple dataset comparison and query. One purpose is to reduce the high cognitive workload of understanding complex interactions within the large attribute space. The HumMod Browser produced can give physiologists flexible control over the visualization displayed for quick understanding of complicated simulation results. The visualization is constructed through the metaphorical bubble interface to allow dynamic view controls and the data relationships and context informaiton unfold as physiologists querying groups of connected bubbles within the hierarchical or causal relationships. HumMod Browser contributions to the interaction design and provides multi-scale coordinated interactive exploration for a new type of physiological modeling data.

Bowman","Few production virtual environment (VE) applications involve complex three-dimensional (3D) interaction. Our long-term collaboration with architects and engineers in designing 3D user interfaces (3D UIs) has revealed some of the causes: existing interaction tasks and/or techniques are either too generic when isolated from the application context, or too specific to be reusable. We propose a new design approach called domain-specific design (DSD) that sits between the generic and specific design approaches, with an emphasis on using domain knowledge in 3D interaction techniques. We also describe an interaction design framework encompassing generic, domain-specific, and application-specific interaction tasks and techniques. This framework can be used by designers to think of ways to produce domain-specific interaction techniques. We present a particular DSD method, and demonstrate its use for the design of cloning techniques in a structural engineering application.

Auchus, David H. Laidlaw","We report the impact of display characteristics (stereo and size) on task performance in diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (DMRI) in a user study with 12 participants. The hypotheses were that (1) adding stereo and increasing display size would improve task accuracy and reduce completion time, and (2) the greater the complexity of a spatial task, the greater the benefits of an improved display. Thus we expected to see greater performance gains when detailed visual reasoning was required. Participants used dense streamtube visualizations to perform five representative tasks: (1) determine the higher average fractional anisotropy (FA) values between two regions, (2) find the endpoints of fiber tracts, (3) name a bundle, (4) mark a brain lesion, and (5) judge if tracts belong to the same bundle. Contrary to our hypotheses, we found the task completion time was not improved by the use of the larger display and that performance accuracy was hurt rather than helped by the introduction of stereo in our study with dense DMRI data. Bigger was not always better. Thus cautious should be taken when selecting displays for scientific visualization applications. We explored the results further using the body-scale unit and subjective size and stereo experiences.",63.0

13,2093857381,EINVis A Visualization Tool for Analyzing and Exploring Genetic Interactions in Large-Scale Association Studies,2013,29,8,1.0,Genetic Epidemiology,"Yubao Wu, Jian Chen, Xiang Zhang",": Epistasis (gene-gene interaction) detection in large-scale genetic association studies has recently drawn extensive research interests as many complex traits are likely caused by the joint effect of multiple genetic factors. The large number of possible interactions poses both statistical and computational challenges. A variety of approaches have been developed to address the analytical challenges in epistatic interaction detection. These methods usually output the identified genetic interactions and store them in flat file formats. It is highly desirable to develop an effective visualization tool to further investigate the detected interactions and unravel hidden interaction patterns. We have developed EINVis, a novel visualization tool that is specifically designed to analyze and explore genetic interactions. EINVis displays interactions among genetic markers as a network. It utilizes a circular layout (specially, a tree ring view) to simultaneously visualize the hierarchical interactions between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), genes, and chromosomes, and the network structure formed by these interactions. Using EINVis, the user can distinguish marginal effects from interactions, track interactions involving more than two markers, visualize interactions at different levels, and detect proxy SNPs based on linkage disequilibrium. EINVis is an effective and user-friendly free visualization tool for analyzing and exploring genetic interactions. It is publicly available with detailed documentation and online tutorial on the web at http://filer.case.edu/yxw407/einvis/.",

In many instances, genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data must be interpreted in the context of signaling and metabolic pathways to yield testable hypotheses. Since humans can interpret visual information rapidly, a means for interactive visual exploration that lets biologists interpret such data in a comprehensive and exploratory manner would be invaluable. However, humans have limited memory capacity. Current visualization tools have limited viewing and manipulation capabilities to address complex data analysis problems, and visual exploratory tools are needed to reduce the high mental workload imposed on biologists. We present PathRings, a new interactive web-based, scalable biological pathway visualization tool for biologists to explore and interpret biological pathways. PathRings integrates metabolic and signaling pathways from Reactome in a single compound graph visualization, and uses color to highlight genes and pathways affected by input data. Pathways are available for multiple species and analysis of user-defined species or input is also possible. PathRings permits an overview of the impact of gene expression data on all pathways to facilitate visual pattern finding. Detailed pathways information can be opened in new visualizations while maintaining the overview, that form a visual exploration provenance. A dynamic multi-view bubbles interface is designed to support biologistsxe2x80x99 analytical tasks by letting users construct incremental views that further reflect biologistsxe2x80x99 analytical process. This approach decomposes complex tasks into simpler ones and automates multi-view management. PathRings has been designed to accommodate interactive visual analysis of experimental data in the context of pathways defined by Reactome. Our new approach to interface design can effectively support comparative tasks over substantially larger collection than existing tools. The dynamic interaction among multi-view dataset visualization improves the data exploration.

Caban","The adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) and the increased participation of hospitals and clinics in health information exchange systems have resulted in unique longitudinal data that describes a patient's clinical trajectory. In-depth analysis of that information is important to better understand the general course to recovery or the evolution of a particular disease. Unfortunately, modelling and understanding the progression of a disease is still a challenging task given that most often patients take vastly different paths after being diagnosed with a specific disease or condition. The different trajectories patients follow, the individual temporal events that each patient goes through, the uncertainties associated with clinical diagnoses, and the irregular time intervals between clinical diagnoses present challenges to researchers trying to analyze the common trajectories of a set of N patients. This paper presents a graph-based visualization method to interactively analyze the longitudinal clinical trajectory of a group of patients. The system allows users to select a specific set of events or conditions, filter the data based on different thresholds, and compare different cohorts while using an interactive virtual space that expands as the user continues to analyze and explore the data.

In many cases, the outputs of such studies are gene lists which are then examined for enriched biological concepts. One approach to help the researcher interpret large gene datasets is to associate genes and informative terms (iTerm) that are obtained from the biomedical literature using the eGIFT text-mining system. However, examining large lists of iTerm and gene pairs is a daunting task. We have developed WebGIVI, an interactive web-based visualization tool (n  http://raven.anr.udel.edu/webgivi/n  ) to explore gene:iTerm pairs. WebGIVI was built via Cytoscape and Data Driven Document JavaScript libraries and can be used to relate genes to iTerms and then visualize gene and iTerm pairs. WebGIVI can accept a gene list that is used to retrieve the gene symbols and corresponding iTerm list. This list can be submitted to visualize the gene iTerm pairs using two distinct methods: a Concept Map or a Cytoscape Network Map. In addition, WebGIVI also supports uploading and visualization of any two-column tab separated data. WebGIVI provides an interactive and integrated network graph of gene and iTerms that allows filtering, sorting, and grouping, which can aid biologists in developing hypothesis based on the input gene lists. In addition, WebGIVI can visualize hundreds of nodes and generate a high-resolution image that is important for most of research publications.

It becomes strategically important that the results can be communicated among brain scientists effectively. Traditional graphs and charts failed to convey the complex shapes of brain structures which are essential to the understanding of the result statistics from the analyses. These problems could be addressed using interactive visualization strategies that can link those statistics with brain structures in order to provide a better interface to understand brain research results. We present ENIGMA-Viewer, an interactive web-based visualization tool for brain scientists to compare statistics such as effect sizes from meta-analysis results on standardized ROIs (regions-of-interest) across multiple studies. The tool incorporates visualization design principles such as focuscontext and visual data fusion to enable users to better understand the statistics on brain structures. To demonstrate the usability of the tool, three examples using recent research data are discussed via case studies.

By linking visualizations of both statistics and structures, users can gain more insights into the presented data that are otherwise difficult to obtain. ENIGMA-Viewer is an open-source tool, the source code and sample data are publicly accessible through the NITRC website (n  http://www.nitrc.org/projects/enigmaviewer_20n  ). The tool can also be directly accessed online (n  http://enigma-viewer.orgn  ).",

Laidlaw","In a user study comparing four visualization methods for three-dimensional vector data, participants used visualizations from each method to perform five simple but representative tasks: 1) determining whether a given point was a critical point, 2) determining the type of a critical point, 3) determining whether an integral curve would advect through two points, 4) determining whether swirling movement is present at a point, and 5) determining whether the vector field is moving faster at one point than another. The visualization methods were line and tube representations of integral curves with both monoscopic and stereoscopic viewing. While participants reported a preference for stereo lines, quantitative results showed performance among the tasks varied by method. Users performed all tasks better with methods that: 1) gave a clear representation with no perceived occlusion, 2) clearly visualized curve speed and direction information, and 3) provided fewer rich 3D cues (e.g., shading, polygonal arrows, overlap cues, and surface textures). These results provide quantitative support for anecdotal evidence on visualization methods. The tasks and testing framework also give a basis for comparing other visualization methods, for creating more effective methods, and for defining additional tasks to explore further the tradeoffs among the methods.",27.0

Caban, Gaoqi He, Zhiquan Feng, Jian Chen","We integrate literature- and data-driven task analysis methods to derive an initial task taxonomy for electronic health record (EHR) and electronic medical record (EMR) data analysis. An EHR (EMR) is a digital and longitudinal version of a patients health(medical) information and may include all key clinical events relevant to that persons health (medical) history, such as provider, demographics, progress notes, medicine, diagnosis, etc. Our goal is to arrive a task taxonomy for analyzing EHR (EMR) datasets because tasks play an important role in the design and evaluation of visualization techniques. Our method has three stages: data collection, task modelling, and task taxonomy summary. In data collection, we first survey related literature from the past two decades and extract typical tasks and corresponding data by extracting goals and scenarios of the particular work. We introduce multiple continuous relations to describe specific binary or multiple continuous relation-seeking tasks. Finally, we arrive an initial set of task types for EHR/EMR analysis that guide the design and evaluation of visualization techniques.",
